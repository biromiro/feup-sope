# Consider the state of the art of the two current main competing technologies for data storage devices: Solid State Drives (SSD) and Hard Disk Drives (HDD). 

## Name two advantages of SSD over HDD.

Faster and Safer.

## Name two disadvantages of SSD over HDD.

Higher-priced and Less data storage capacity.

## Why is it that Flash NAND storage devices probably take much more time to modify a disk file than to merely append to it?



## Random writes to SSD generally perform better (about twice better) than random reads. Try to find out why...

Due to how writes are made in a SSD, the randomness of a write is not as 'random' as reads can be, as they are very much well controlled and pre-defined. As such, the performance of a random write should be superior to that of a random read since it is more controlled and way closer to the sequential counterpart.
