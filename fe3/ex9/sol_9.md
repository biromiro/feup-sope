# Overbooking

Two costumers enter the barber shop at the same time, verify that a seat is empty and choose to seat on it. Since both of them verify that the seat is empty before any of them actually sit on the chair, the chair appears to be empty for both and will be occupied by both as well, causing overbooking.

# Deadlock

If a barber verifies that the seats are all empty right before a costumer actually seats on them will cause the barber to sleep while waiting for costumers to enter the barber shop and the costumer to wait for the barber, causing a deadlock.
